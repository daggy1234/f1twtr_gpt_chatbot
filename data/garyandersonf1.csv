But after a year with Yamaha it was great to work with Brian Hart, he did great things with it and the work that year made sure it was a strong engine for 1994.	en	[]	[]	[]	3	8	88	[]	[]	https://twitter.com/GaryAndersonF1/status/1223598809277718529	False	https://twitter.com/wearetherace/status/1223598018890473477	0								[]

The reliability was also poor - we even had fresh engines seize while warming them up on the car stands. I thought it would make a good boat anchor but as an F1 engine, I’m afraid not.	en	[]	[]	[]	5	12	141	[]	[]	https://twitter.com/GaryAndersonF1/status/1223247481145786368	False	https://twitter.com/wearetherace/status/1223244317772472323	0								[]

The 2021 rule changes are a good starting point but it's about the longer-term. Ambition is important, but so is realism and if those are balanced properly then the team can get there - but there's no short-cuts.	en	[]	[]	[]	2	2	37	[]	[]	https://twitter.com/GaryAndersonF1/status/1223192105369194496	False		0								[]

It's essential that the team’s great strengths, which are its racing and technical group, are built on and the ownership doesn’t get carried away.	en	[]	[]	[]	1	8	83	[]	[]	https://twitter.com/GaryAndersonF1/status/1223192104161116160	False		0								[]

Andrew Green, now Racing Point technical director, did the suspension, driveline and steering. Mark Smith, later at Red Bull, the engine installation and gearbox. I did the chassis composites and aero but we all pitched in on everything.	en	[]	[]	[]	30	47	495	[]	[]	https://twitter.com/GaryAndersonF1/status/1222927161436397569	False	https://twitter.com/wearetherace/status/1222925984070094849	0								[]
